### A Gentle Introduction to ROS Examples in Rospy.

I begin studying ROS for my master thesis. This fantastic book called [A Gentle Introduction to ROS](http://www.cse.sc.edu/~jokane/agitr/) was very helping for me. Examples in this written in C++. I am going to code in Python. So I rewrite examples in Python. I tried to not change variable and function names. Also keep same statement order to make codes understandable by looking C++ versions.

Don't forget to make python script executable or ros can't run python code. Also don't forget .py suffix.

```
rosrun package-name executable-name.py
```
